# GRADE BID

* I believe the grade I deserve for the class is an A-

AS PER MY CONTRACT I HAVE

1. Kept my KWL up to date
2. Submitted functional Homework Assignments whilst implementing functions I could complete at the time, further, I attempted all required functions of Homework Assignments and submitted them all on time bar illness
3. Explored the concept of projectile motion using gravity, air resistance and triganometric math and added this to my Miscellaneous file
4. Submitted working implementations of all required features in homework assignments except for gravity in the platformer
5. Submitted Revisions of 50% of my Homework Assignments with additional features to the first submission taking inspiration from potential challenges
6. Created a final game which in my opinion:
    1. looks shelf ready
    2. Incorperates methods such as error handling and file handling and friction coefficient physics which was beyond the scope of the in class assignments
    3. Contains and adapts collisions and vector math (In-class concepts) to suit my required functions
7. I met more than 90% of my KWL targets &rarr; evidence of these targets being met are in my README
8. Learned git for the first time and how to use github for version control/ backup

Furthermore, I hope you can see I have worked hard in order to improve my grade standing from midway through the course by producing updated versions of assignments that show how my design and coding style has improved. 

I have spent a long time on my final game and hope this shows the progress you want to see and base marks on.

I deduced my expected grade because I believe I have upheld my contract almost fully excpect for the platformer due to my struggles with gravity &rarr; I will work on this concept over winter break.

# EXTRA CREDIT

* I have struggled ultimately this term with time management and adapting to the course style at Union. I'm not sure if this is something you offer but if so I would welcome any possibility of extra credit and promise to attempt it to the best of my ability in order to raise my grade.

# THANKYOU, THE CLASS HAS BEEN VERY ENJOYABLE AND I HOPE I GET CHANCE TO TAKE ONE OF YOUR CLASSES AGAIN THIS YEAR
