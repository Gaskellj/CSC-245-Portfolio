This is my contract for CSC-245: The Computer Science of Computer Games with John Rieffel.

To earn a C I will,

* Keep my KWL up-to-date and demonstrate which objectives I have met/ failed to meet
* Submit all working porgramming assignments within the correct timeframe implementing the features I am capable of at the time of creation
* Attend office hours if there are any of the required functions of homeworks I cannot implement

To earn a B I will,

* Explore python/game concepts outside of class and submit them to my portfolio in a miscellaneous section
* Submit working programming assignments with all required features implemented
* Submit revisions of at least 1/3 of Homework Assignments using feedback to demonstrate progress in programming style and competency

To earn an A I will also, 

* Complete a final game which:
    * will look shelf-ready and take into account elements of HCI for ease of use
    * incorperate methods or game physics that are beyond the scope of the in class agenda
    * contain at least 2 of the concepts explored in Homework assignments
* Meet 90%+ of my KWL objectives and be able to demonstrate these concepts on the spot
* Collaberate with my fellow classmates and make myself available to help wherever I can
* Submit revisions of at least 50% of Homework Assignments using feedback and containing at least 1 Challenge objective

I will do this whilst maintaining academic integrity by abiding by the Union College Honor Code
